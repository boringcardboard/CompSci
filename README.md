README

This application takes a .csv file which contains an x and y coordinate and a single character, and prints out block letters. 
It reads the highest x and y values from the .csv file, and using that it creates a 2D array filled with whitespaces. 
Once the array is initialized, the program prints out every coordinate pair’s character value, which makes the block letters appear. 

USAGE

Upon running the program, it will prompt the user for a valid .csv file which exists in the program’s directory (Ex “input.csv”). The program will exit if an invalid file name is entered.
